Run FrameDummy and get a fake window frame around any image or screen area. The frame dummy looks and behaves like a real desktop window. Use it for photo frames, messages, pranks, greetings, birthday cards, or software development. Try the new Prank Mode that opens any program or link when the fake window is clicked, and hides all clues to its identity. Software developers can also use FrameDummy to try new interfaces simply by dragging and dropping the new design. You can move the fake frame over any other window or screen area, and resize it to any desired size. You can also change its title and icon, hide some buttons, or remove it from the Windows taskbar. FrameDummy has a simple, minimalist interface, and it's very easy to use. Run the program, right click or press Ctrl+S, and start customizing the fake desktop window. No installation is required: FrameDummy is completely portable!

## Try FrameDummy
